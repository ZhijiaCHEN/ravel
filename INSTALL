INSTALL RAVEL
-------------

See http://ravel-net.org/download for pre-packaged VMs.


INSTALL FROM SOURCE
-------------------
To install Ravel from source, first check out a copy of the code:

    git clone http://github.com/ravel-net/ravel

Run the Ravel install script:

    cd ravel
    util/install.sh [options]

Options for `install.sh` are:
    * -a: install all required packages (Mininet, Pox, and PostgreSQL)
    * -m: install only Mininet and Pox (ie, Mininet install with `-kmnvp`)
    * -p: install only PostgreSQL
    * -r: install Python libraries required by Ravel, configure PostgreSQL and
          extensions


CONFIGURE POSTGRESQL
--------------------
By default, PostgreSQL uses peer authentication, in which the client's username
authenticates a connection to the database.  Ravel requires either trust (any
user can connect) or_md5 (password-based) authentication.

To set modify the authentication method, edit:

    /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf

Set the last field on the following lines to trust or md5:

    local    all   postgres	    trust #or md5
    local    all   all		    trust #or md5

Alternatively, when running `install.sh` with `-a` or `-r`, you will be prompted
to make this change automatically.


OPTIONAL: CONFIGURE OVS-OFCTL
-----------------------------
Ravel supports multiple protocols for database triggers to interact with
OpenFlow switches.  This allows changes in the database to be propagated to the
network.  Supported protocols, which can be configured in ravel.cfg, are:
    * message queues (the default protocol)
    * RPC
    * ovs-ofctl

If using the `ovs-ofctl` command, you must set passwordless sudo so database
triggers can invoke the command.  First, add postgres to sudoers:

    sudo adduser postgres sudo

Edit /etc/sudoers (e.g., using "sudo visudo") and set the user specification to:

    sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWORD:ALL
